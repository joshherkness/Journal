## What is Jekyll?

> ***What is Jekyll?***

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

Documentation can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

## How do you install it?

You'll nee to begin by installing Jekyll *via* RubyGems.  In your Terminal, use the command `gem install jekyll`.   This may take a few seconds, but please don't claw your eyes out.

> **Note**: You can install Jekyll in the current directory using the command `jekyll new .`.

After you have Jekyll installed, your ready to create a project.  Use the command `jekyll new myblog`, replacing *myblog* with the title of your project.  This should create a demo project, which can be run.

To test your project, open up the Terminal, and move into your project folder: `cd myblog`.  Once in your project folder, run the command `jekyll serve`.  This should open a local instance of your project, and display it at the *url* [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

> **Note**: Jekyll does support a number of extra ***Optional*** features in clouding LaTex and MathJax.  Read more [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/).

## How do you use it?

- `jekyll build` will cause the current folder to generate into a ./_site
- `jekyll build --destination <destination>` will cause the current folder to be generated into <destination>
- `jekyll build --source <source> --destination <destination>` will cause the <source> folder be generated into <destination>
- `jekyll build --watch` will cause the current folder to be generated into a ./_site, watch for changes, and regenerate automatically

### Using the server

```python
$ jekyll serve
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/
# Auto-regeneration: enabled. Use `--no-watch` to disable.
```

``` ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```
$ jekyll serve --detach
# => Same as `jekyll serve` but will detach from the current terminal.
#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.
#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep jekyll` and kill the instance. [Read more](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/shell/jobz5.html).
```

A basic Jekyll site will look something like this:

```
.
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.textile
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.markdown
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.textile
|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.textile
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _site
└── index.html
```

## Configuration

Any configuration can be done in the `_config.yml` folder.  Some configuration possibilities that you should be aware of include:

```
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "" # an empty string here means all files in the project
    values:
      layout: "default"
```

This will allow you to set a default default front matter variables and other variables for  all pages and posts in your projects.  This is convenient because you have no need to use front matter ate the beginning of your posts.

You can also ouse this for scope value pairs:

```
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "my-site"
  -
    scope:
      path: "projects"
      type: "pages" # previously `page` in Jekyll 2.2.
    values:
      layout: "project" # overrides previous default layout
      author: "Mr. Hyde"
```

Some other configuration options include

```
# Where things are
source:      .
destination: ./_site
plugins:     ./_plugins
layouts:     ./_layouts
data_source: ./_data
collections: null
```

I also recommend modifying the conversion configuration like this:

```
# Conversion
markdown:  redcarpet
highlighter: pygments
excerpt_separator: "\n\n"
```

## Front matter

Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file.  This block will resemble:

```
---
layout: post
title: Blogging Like a Hacker
---
```

Some defined front matter variables include:

- `layout` - layout file must be placed in the _layouts directory
- `permalink` - if you need the *url* to be something other than `/year/month/day/title.html`, then set it to this variable
- `published` - *true* or *false*, depending on if you want the post to show up when the site is generated.
- `category and categories` - instead of placing posts in folders, use a YAML list or space separated string in order to group posts
- `tags` - Similar to `categories`
 
> **Note**: Custom front matter variables are not predefined and are mixed into the data sent to the Liquid tempting engine during conversion.  For example, the variable title is not defined, and can be accessed using  `{{ page.title}}` within a layout.
	
Pre defined variables for posts are available out-of-the-box to be used for a post.

- `date` - overrides the date from the name of the post, and is used to ensure correct sorting of posts.
 
> **Note**: If you don't want to repeat yourself by defining the same front matter variables, then just define defaults for them.  This works for predefined, and custom variables.

## Creating A Post

One thing that makes Jekyll so nice, is the fact that it is blog aware.  What this means is that you can maintain a blog online just by managing a folder of text files on your computer.

Posts should be placed in the `_posts` directory, and use the naming format:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile
```

## Including images and resources

At some point you'll want to include images and resources along with your text content.  In order to do this, you should have a directory named `assets` or `downloads`, where all your resources are placed.  You will be able to link to this folder using the `site.url` variable.  For example:

Including images in a post

```
… which is shown in the screenshot below:
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/screenshot.jpg)
```

Including a PDF in a post

```
… you can [get the PDF]({{ site.url }}/assets/mydoc.pdf) directly.
```

> **Note**: Use the `{{ site.url}}` only if you **know** your site will only ever be displayed at the root URL of your domain.  In this case, you can reference assets directly with just `/path/file.jpg`.
